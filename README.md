# Number Cruncher

This Python script reads a file (`numbers.txt`), processes numerical values, and generates reports. It:  

- Computes the sum, average, minimum, and maximum of valid numbers.  
- Logs invalid entries to `error_log.txt`.  
- Saves a summary report in `report.txt` and the sum in `sum.txt`.  

### Usage
1. Ensure `numbers.txt` contains one number per line.  
2. Run the script:  
   ```bash
   python3 number_cruncher.py
   ```
3. Check the output files for results.  

Handles missing files gracefully and logs errors. ðŸš€
